;; Description:
;;
;;	Sometimes it is  desirable to  have different  major modes  in  one
;;	buffer.  One   such   case occurs   when   editing  comments  in  a
;;	programming language buffer.  Here it  might be desirable to use  a
;;	totally  different mode than the  one used  for editing the program
;;	code itself.
;;
;;	I have adoped this practice for editing Prolog.  The code itself is
;;	edited   in prolog-mode,   whereas  the   comments  are edited   in
;;	LaTeX-mode.
;;
;;	It  is  desirable to use different   modes instead of enhancing one
;;	mode  because much  efford has  already  been put in various  modes
;;	which needs not to be duplicated.
;;
;;	The multi-mode minor  mode provides  a means  to accomplish  such a
;;	feature.
;;
;;	The modes  are described  by  initializing strings.   I assume that
;;	certain tokens (i.e. transition strings)  indicate the places where
;;	a new mode should be entered. To  determine the mode  at a point it
;;	is only neccessary to find the last transition string before point.
;;
;;	The desired   modes are described  in  a list of   pairs or triples
;;	consisting  of   a  transition   string  and a   mode   (a symbol).
;;	Optionally a function symbol can be specified which is evaluated to
;;	activate  the desired mode.  Additionally   the mode in absence  of
;;	preceding transition strings has to be specified.
;;
;;
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;;	1. Ensure that multi-mode.el is on the load-path.
;;	2. For efficiency it might be desirable to byte-compile 
;;	   multi-mode.el.
;;	3. Put the following in your .emacs file or a similar place
;;	   where it is loaded when needed.
;;
;;	   (autoload 'multi-mode
;;		     "multi-mode"
;;		     "Allowing multiple major modes in a buffer."
;;		     t)
;;
;;	4. Define  your own  incarnation of multi  mode  to serve as major
;;	   mode.  This can be done in your .emacs file.  E.g.
;;
;;	   (defun multi-c-fundamental-mode () (interactive)
;;	     (multi-mode 1
;;			 'c-mode
;;			 '(\"/*\" fundamental-mode my-fundamental-setup)
;;			 '(\"*/\" c-mode)))
;;
;;	   This major mode can now be used to turn on the multi-mode in the
;;	   minibuffer, or in the auto-mode-alist, or in the local variables
;;	   of a file. E.g.
;;
;;	   (setq auto-mode-alist
;;		 (cons '("\\.[ch]$" . multi-c-fundamental-mode)
;;		 auto-mode-alist)
;;
;;
;; Bugs and Problems:
;;	- It is rather easy to hang my whole workstation when
;;	  multi-mode-transitions has not a proper value.
;;	  For sake of efficiency I omit finer type checking to avoid this
;;	  problem.
;;	  CURE: Never try to change the variable yourself. Use the
;;		function multi-mode instead.
;;
;; To do:
;;	- The generalization of transition strings to regular expressions
;;	  seems to be straight forward. For efficience reasons I will do it
;;	  only upon request.
;;
;;	- No provisions have been made to make the key bindings accessible
;;	  in all modes. This might be desirable.

;;; Definition of the minor mode

(defun multi-mode (&optional arg &optional initial-mode &rest transitions) 
  "Allowing multiple major modes in a buffer.

Toggle multi mode. With numeric argument turn on multi mode if the argument
is positive.

Sometimes it is desirable to have different major modes in one buffer.  One
such case occurs  when editing comments  in a programming  language buffer.
Here it  might be desirable  to use a totally  different mode  than the one
used for editing the program code itself.

It is desirable   to use different  modes  instead  of enhancing one   mode
because much effort has  already been put  in various modes which needs not
to be duplicated.

The multi-mode minor mode provides a means to accomplish such a feature.

The  modes are described  by initializing  strings.  I assume that  certain
tokens (i.e.  transition  strings)  indicate  the places  where a  new mode
should be entered.  To determine  the mode at a point  it is only necessary
to find the last transition string before point.

The desired modes are described in a list of pairs or triples consisting of
a transition string and  a mode (a  symbol).  Optionally a function  symbol
can   be specified   which  is evaluated  to   activate  the desired  mode.
Additionally the mode in absence of preceding transition  strings has to be
specified.

When called not interactively there are additional arguments to specify the
transitions.

INITIAL-MODE  is a symbol denoting   a major mode   to  be used before  any
transition strings are present before point.

The remaining optional arguments are pairs
	(TOKEN MODE)
or triples
	(TOKEN MODE FUNCTION)

The first element TOKEN is  a string which indicates  the token to activate
the mode MODE specified in the second argument. Optionally a third argument
can  be given. The  symbol FUNCTION is  used as a function  to be called to
turn on the mode given as second argument. It defaults to MODE.

Consider the following example:

(multi-mode 1
	    c-mode
	    (\"/*\" fundamental-mode my-fundamental-setup)
	    (\"*/\" c-mode))

The first argument forces multi-mode to be  turned on.  The second argument
declares the default mode to be c-mode. Thus at the beginning of the buffer
c-mode is turned on. If a '/*'  is found before point then fundamental-mode
may be turned on. This is done using the function my-fundamental-setup.

If a '*/' is found before point then c-mode may be activated. Which mode is
used depends on the last activating  pattern before point.  In this example
everything between /* and */ can be edited  in fundamental mode. Everything
else is in c-mode.

See also the documentation of multi-mode-beware."
